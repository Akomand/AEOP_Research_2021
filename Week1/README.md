# Week 1 Materials
## Introduction to Machine Learning and Tools
## MONDAY
### Setting up your Python and Anaconda environment

Python is an incredibly powerful language and most tasks in data science and machine learning are carried out using Python. So, we need to first get python set up on our computers so that we make use of the language to develop our ML models. You will most likely get this set up in the morning programming session.

### Getting python3 installed on your machine


### Install Anaconda 



## TUESDAY
### Taking a look at some machine learning models

<b>Supervised Learning</b> - Machine Learning for which you have data along with its labels to train a model to learn from experience.
<b>Unsupervised Learning</b> - Machine Learning where you have no predefined labels given with your data. Task is to find structure among the data points and find a pattern. Much more difficult than supervised learning techniques.

Linear Regression <br>
Logistic Regression <br>
support vector machine <br>
decision trees <br>
neural networks <br>
k-nearest neighbors <br>
k-means clustering <br>
