# Week 1 Materials
## Introduction to Machine Learning and Tools

### TUESDAY
We will introduce machine learning and its various applications to real world problems. We discuss the two broad types of machine learning: supervised and
unsupervised learning, and discuss the regression vs. classification tasks. Unsupervised learning topics such as recommender systems and clustering are discussed as well.

Homework: Read Abstract and Introduction (Section A, B, and C) (until page 4) of "A Very Brief Introduction to Machine Learning
With Applications to Communication Systems" found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02342.pdf

## WEDNESDAY
We will look at the Linear Regression learning algorithm for continuous data, dive into the mathematics behind the technique, and look at an application of linear regression in code.

## THURSDAY
We will discuss the Logistic Regression learning algorithm for classification tasks, look at the mathematics behind the technique, and look at an application of logistic regression on a dataset in code.

## FRIDAY
We discuss a powerful learning algorithm called the Neural Network and the intuition behind processes such as forward propagation and backpropagation. We also look at a special neural network for image data called the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We apply the vanilla neural network and the convolutional neural network to the FashionMNIST dataset in PyTorch to observe how well the algorithms perform.
