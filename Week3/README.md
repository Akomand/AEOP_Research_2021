# Week 3 Materials
## Reading Research and Writing in Latex
### MONDAY
We will explore what research in machine learning looks like, how to read research papers, and read some Question Answering papers using the strategies we learn.

Reading Research
1. Read Abstract (Highlight important words/concepts)
2. Read Introduction (Highlight important words/concepts)
3. Analyze architecture/conceptual diagrams to understand paper better
4. Read the conclusion to determine the overall contribution of the paper
5. Glance through experiments to see how well their approach performed compared to other methods they list and why
6. Finally, read their approach high-level first and then in detail (with the math) on the second run
