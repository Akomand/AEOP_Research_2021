# Week 3 Materials
## Reading Research and Writing in Latex
### MONDAY
We will explore what research in machine learning looks like, how to read research papers, and read some Question Answering papers using the strategies we learn.

Reading Research
1. Read Abstract (Highlight important words/concepts)
2. Read Introduction (Highlight important words/concepts)
3. Analyze architecture/conceptual diagrams to understand paper better
4. Read the conclusion to determine the overall contribution of the paper
5. Glance through experiments to see how well their approach performed compared to other methods they list and why
6. Finally, read their approach high-level first and then in detail (with the math) on the second run

- Highlight concepts in BLUE<br>
- Highlight results/experiment in GREEN <br>
- Highlight approach in ORANGE <br>
- Highlight contributions in red

### TUESDAY
We will find papers in Question Answering and read through them in detail. We will also look at possible code implementations of 
methods proposed and have a group discussion. We will try to find an interesting application of the question answering task.


### WEDNESDAY
We will do activities for writing using LaTeX including:
- Setting up section headers
- IEEE double column format
- Creating tables
- Inserting images
- Citing references
- General writing procedure


### THURSDAY
We will find papers in Question Answering and read through them in detail. We will also look at possible code implementations of 
methods proposed. 


### FRIDAY
We will find papers in Question Answering and read through them in detail. We will also look at possible code implementations of 
methods proposed.
