# Week 2 Materials
## Introduction to Natural Language Processing
### MONDAY (Text preprocessing and word embeddings)
We will be going over text preprocessing techniques including 
- Tokenization
- Denoising text w/ Regex
- Removing stopwords
- Stemming
- Lemmatization
- Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- Continuous Bag-of-words and Skip-gram
- Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)

Suggested Reading (Word2Vec): "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf)]


### TUESDAY (Topic Modeling)
Part I: We will deep dive into what topic modeling is and its use-cases. We'll look at a specific topic modeling technique known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to mine topics from a corpus.

Part II: We will disect apart the "A Very Brief Introduction to Machine Learning" paper and the below paper on Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

Assignment: Research a paper on a topic of your choice in the field of NLP from the following list
- Sentiment Analysis
- Machine Translation
- Named Entity Recognition
- Question Answering


### WEDNESDAY (Sequence Models)
Part I: We will look at sequence models for NLP such as the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a special variant called Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and apply them
to the task of text classification and machine translation given a corpora of text.

Part II: We will disect the below suggested paper on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):

### THURSDAY (Transformers)

Part I: We will talk about transformers from the "Attention is all you need" paper and discuss their effectiveness over regular RNNs and LSTMs. We will also deep dive into the Transformer architecture and its various components.

### FRIDAY (Transfer Learning)

Part I: We will talk about pretrained transformer-based models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers) and ALBERT and discuss how we can fine-tune these models for any task we want using the HuggingFace library.

Assignment: Over the weekend, find 2 papers (published in 2018 or later) covering the Question Answering task in Natural Language Processing using either Sequence models, Transformers, or some other unique technique. You can start with Google Scholar, but also try to use Connected Papers to search for these papers since it returns the most relevant and recent papers as well as those related.
