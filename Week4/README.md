# Week 4 Materials
## Project: Question Answering Paper and Experiments
### MONDAY
Today, we will choose a direction for our research paper on question answering from the following list
- A Survey of Question Answering
- A Comparative Study of Pre-trained Models on the Question Answering Task

We will also read a couple papers on other pre-trained models to get an idea of what methods are being used for the Question Answering Task and look into some datasets we can use to Fine-tune our models.

### TUESDAY
Explore Datasets:
- NewsQA
- SQUAD 2.0
- QuAC
- Natural Questions
- TriviaQA
- CommonsenseQA
- HotpotQA

We will use the datasets we found and preprocess them and get them ready for the models.
